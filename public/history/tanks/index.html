            <p>
              In 1970 and 1971, BMW
              motorcycles had a 6.3 gallon fuel tank. This is the standard
              tank. This tank was available by special order in 1972. Many
              1973 /5s had it as well. The 1970 and 1971 gas cap hinges from
              the front of the fuel tank. The 1972 and 1973 gas cap hinges
              from the back. In mid-1973, the standard tank had the cut-out
              for the brake master cylinder that would later appear on the
              /6.The black thing on the fuel tank is a large rubber pad. All
              standard tanks had these. When reattaching one of these to a
              painted fuel tank, 3m Super Weatherstrip (black) adhesive
              works well. This automotive type of adhesive is available at
              most auto parts stores. Photo is from BMW's archives.
              According to Phil Marx, slot blade screws affix the roundel to
              the fuel tank for 1970 and 1971.</p>

            <p>In 1972, most motorcycles that BMW exported to the United
              States came with a fuel tank of less than 4.5 gallons. The
              chrome panels mounted, as seen below in this
              advertisement, were standard in the U.S. Notice the lack
              of pinstriping around the chrome panel. Notice the chrome
              battery cover? That was also a feature for the 1972
              model. These tanks were also available in Europe. The
              chrome paneled tanks were called "toasters."

            <p>
              This tank was not well received in the US market. Many
              motorcyclists thought the chrome panels were ugly. It held less fuel
              than the standard 6-gallon tank. Do not estimate a /5's year of
              manufacture by the fuel tank. These were frequently swapped for
              six-gallon tanks, and frequently on the dealers' showrooms. Also,
              some 1973 models were exported with the toaster tank. Dealers sent
              many toaster tanks, complete with toaster panels, to the
              scrapyard. </p>

            <p>In 1972, the 6-gallon standard tank was available by special order
              for an additional $25. Small rubber pads were available to replace the
              chrome fuel tank panels, but only by special order from the dealer.
              Philips head screws hold roundel on the fuel tank. Advertisement
              scanned from an old copy of "Cycle" magazine. </p>

            <p>Then there was 1973, the year of great confusion for
              restorers. Early 1973 models had chrome panels and the fuel tanks had
              pinstripes. Also in 1973, these rubber pads were available, and were
              supplied on the small tank after they stopped putting chrome panels on
              the fuel tanks. These pads were also available earlier by special
              order. It is the same fuel tank as the Toaster tank, only instead of
              chrome panels, it had a rubber pad. Indentations on the black pad fit
              over the prongs that support the toaster panel. Also in 1973, the
              6-gallon tank was available as an option, for about $25. Click on the

            <p>This green tank is a Police tank. Notice that it looks
              very similar to the 6-gallon tank? It even has the same
              large rubber pad.But on top, there is a lid. And inside
              that lid is a carrying place. The black one is police tank
              with a radio still in place. Click on the photos to see a
