      <h1>5 United's Festivals of Five</h1>

      <p>A "Festival of Fives" is a regional gathering of BMW /5 riders. Our rallies are informal and generally have
        fewer than 100 in attendance. Most riders are on vintage and classic BMWs with a high percentage being the /5
        model, although all riders are welcome. We encourage you to gas up that airhead and come to a Festival near
        you!</p>

      <p>If you have a 5 United,  /5-friendly rally or event that you'd like to share, please feel free to add this to the <a href="https://groups.io/g/Slash5United/calendar">5 United Group Calendar</a>.</p>

      <p>Bring your old BMW Airhead to the Denver Colorado Airhead

        will be a double garage and large area of concrete
        driveway. Spring tune ups and oil changes as well as
        setting valves, spark plug changes, timing, carburetor
        synchronizing, fluid and filter replacements, exhaust nut
        service as well as anything else you'd like to try. We
        will be able to collect your used oil for proper
        disposal. We've got molly grease if you want to do a
        spline lube.</p>

      <p>Tools on hand include a steering head wrench, hand tools,
        an exhaust nut wrench, timing lamp, torque wrenches, swing
        arm bearing puller, a small air compressor, an airhead
        manometer as well as a colormetric device, a multi-meter,
        grease, and anything else that you would like to bring
        along yourself. There will also be a Clymer’s Manual and a
        Haynes booklet on hand for reference and online access if
        you want to visit Snowbum’s or Dwayne’s sites.</p>

      <p>Shutdown will be at 5:00PM sharp. If you'd like to try
        something ambitious please let us know in advance. If you
        would like to offer some particular expertise to the
        others, let us know that too! Parts, oil and oil filters
        and any tools you might need beyond those already
        mentioned are up to you. If there is something nifty you’d
        like to share – Bring it!</p>

        available. Donations for anything other than that can be
        taken on the spot.</p>
