      <h1>/5 Tire Options</h1>

      <div class="row prose">
	<div class="span12">

          <p>Once in a while, someone would like to ask "what tires do
            I need to use on my bike? Any suggestions?" Then all hell
            breaks loose, because everyone has different preferences
            where it concerns tires.
          </p>

          <p>First of all, your rims are 1,85 front, 1,85 rear for
            pre-72 bikes and 1,85 front, 2,15 rear post-72. Diameter
            of the wheels is 19 inch front, 18 inch rear.</p>

          <p>The original tires were either Continental or Metzeler,
            and came in the sizes 3,25-19 front and 4,00-18 rear.</p>

          <pre>
A quick word on speed and load indices :
http://www.webbikeworld.com/Motorcycle-tires/tire-data.htm
So what can you buy today, and what are the manufacturer’s specs ?
Avon :
http://www.avon-tyres.com/
Avon specs the “Roadriders” for the /5.
3.25-19 54V front at 2,30 bar or 33 psi.
Interestingly, they spec it at 2,00 bar / 29 psi for the R75/5 only (?)
4.00-18 64V rear at 2,50 bar or 36psi
Some other tires (“tyres”) that Avon has, but does NOT spec for the /5:
“Roadrunners” AM20 in 325-19 54H front and AM21 400-18 64H rear, these were *previously* spec-ed
for /5’s
One could use, as a very sticky sports tire, the AM18 “Supervenom” REAR tire in 100/90 57V 19 on the
FRONT and combine it with a Bridgestone BT45 rear. I know of no-one who tried that on a BMW.
Also possible for the front is AM 41 “Venom” 100/90-19 57H, also available with white walls – no
matching whitewall rear tire though. This would probably look a little ridiculous.
In their classic range, Avon has the “Speedmaster” AM6 front in 3.25-19-TT 57S, in combination with the
“Safety Mileage MKII” AM7 in 4.00-18 TT 65S.
Bridgestone/Firestone :
Bridgestone used to spec different tires in the USA and Europe - right now, they don’t spec any tires for
the airheads in Europe anymore. There are available sizes though, even though their website is
completely messed up and it is impossible to get actual availability, ratings and sizes of these tires:
http://www.bridgestone.co.uk
100/90-19 for the front :
Battlax BT-45
Exedra G701
If you feel like riding through mud a lot :
Trailwing 101
Then there are a lot of OEM tires of different bikes which are probably impossible to get anyway.
110/90-18 for the rear :
Battlax BT-45
There used to be Battlax BT-45 available in inch-sizes, but due to the website not working properly it is
impossible to verify whether these are still being sold – this was their former recommendation for BMW
airheads:
3,25-19 54H TL BT-45F front at 2,5 bar or 35 psi
4,00-18 64H TT BT-45R rear at 2,8 bar 38,5 psi
In the USA Bridgestone still specs the Spitfire for /5 (unavailable in Europe):
http://www.motorcycle-karttires.com
100/90-19 Spitfire S11 57H front
110/90-18 Spitfire S11 61H rear
Of course the BT-45 is also available in the US.
100/90-19 BW TL 57V for the front (or TT 57H, which I suspect to be the same tire)
110/90-18 BW TL 61H for the rear
Metzeler
http://www.us.metzelermoto.com or http://www.metzelermoto.co.uk
Metzeler has a number of choices – again, they do not officially recommend any tires anymore for the /5.
Tires that fit :
Lasertec front:
3.25 - 19 M/C 54H TL
3.25 - 19 M/C 54V TL
100/90 - 19 M/C 57H TL
100/90 - 19 M/C 57V TL
Lasertec Rear:
4.00 - 18 M/C 64V TL
110/90 - 18 M/C 61H TL
ME88 Marathon rear (recommended for later airheads – wider spacer needed !): 120/90 B 18 71H REINF
TL
Front is Me880
100/90 - 19 M/C 57H TL
Or in whitewall (no matching rear) : 100/90 - 19 M/C 57S
Also available :
Tourance 100/90 - 19 M/C 57H for the front, no matching rear.
Previously spec-ed as “alternative” by Metzeler and still available :
3,25-19 54S TL ME11 Perfect front at 2,2 bar or 31 psi
4,00-18 64H TL ME77 Perfect rear at 2,3 bar or 33 psi
Continental
http://www.conti-online.com
Refreshingly, Conti has a working fitment guide ...
They suggest for the /5 :
3,25-19 54H TL TK22RC front
4,00-18 64H TL TK44RC rear
These were formerly called “Supertwin”
Alternatively they give :
3,25-19 54 H TT RB2 front
4,00-18 64 S/H TT K112 rear
“An economic, all-weather tyre combination”, OEM on our BMW’s
Or else :
3.25-19 54 H/V TL TKH 23 front
110/90-18 61H TT/TL TKH 24 rear
They mention better wear and a damping layer in the front tire that would prevent handlebar wobble.
Pressure specs from Conti for all tires are 2.1 bar for front, 2.3 bar for rear.
Dunlop
http://www.dunlopmotorcycle.com
Dunlop stopped spec-ing tires for the /5 as well.
Some fit though –
D404 Front 100/90-19 62H
D404 Rear 110/90-18 61H
491 Elite II
MM90-19 Front at 2.3 bar or 33 psi (former pressure recommendation)
110/90 B18 rear at 2,55 bar or 36 psi (former pressure recommendation)
The 491 Elite was replaced by the Elite 3 –from the website, the 491 seems to be still available though.
Elite 3 MM90-19 front will fit
There is no fitting Elite3 rear tire.
Other front tires :
D401 Cruiser at 100/90-19 57H Front
F24 100/90-19 TT 57S Front
Or :
F11 100/90-19 57H Front (at 2,3 bar or 32psi – former pressure recommendation)
K627 110/90-18 rear (at 2,55 bar or 36psi – former pressure recommendation)
Or :
K70 3.25-19TT 54P front
K70 4.00 18 64S rear
The K591 has been taken out of the assortment, and has been replaced by GT501 Sport Bias. However,
the front K591 only is still available as a front tire for Harleys in 100/90-19 51V
You can try and put these on, but the rear tire will be too big. This can be solved by using a spacer on the
rear wheel with BMW part nr 36 31 2 301 737, which is 10.7mm wide instead of 9.2 and hopefully makes
the tire clear the swingarm.
GT501 100/90-19 57V
GT501 120/90-18 65V
no pressure specs here.
Michelin
http://two-wheels.michelin.com
Michelin recommends only one thing: the Macadam 50E/50
50E 3,25-19-54H TT/TL on the front at 2,2 bar or 31 psi
50 4,00-18-64H TT/TL on the rear at 2,4 bar or 35 psi
The Anakee front tire will fit, as will the A39/M39 and M45 rears
Pirelli
http://www.pirellityre.com
Pirelli also stopped recommending tires for the /5. Some still fit.
Scorpion MT90 front on/off road
100/90 - 19 M/C 57H TL
Sport Demon
100/90 - 19 M/C 57V TL front
110/90 - 18 M/C 61H TL rear
City Demons (their former recommendation) have been taken out of the assortment in the correct size,
however, some still fit (more or less).
90/90 - 19 M/C 52S front
4.00 - 18 M/C 64S rear
100/90 - 18 M/C 56S TL rear
MT66 Route (front only)
100/90 - 19 57H TL
100/90 - 19 M/C 57S

Kruz
100/90H-19 4PR TL front
IRC
http://www.kintai.com.sg/irc.html
WF910 Front in 100/90-19-57H will fit, as will RS310 and 320
GS11 3,25 H19 4PR front and 4,00 H18 4PR rear are a matched pair.
Most people feel it is important to have the exact right size tires, which means the inch measures and not
the closest metric equivalent. A fatter front tire will make the bike handle like a truck. The difference with a
proper 3,25 is night and day. A fatter rear tire may rub the swingarm unless a wider top-hat spacer is
used, and is in any case a bear to get past the brake drum. Be aware of the fact that tire sizes will vary
between manufacturers, even if the designation is the same. There will also be a difference between TT
and TL tires. You have to use tubes, also in TL tires on our rims, but generally the TT tires, if available,
will be a bit narrower. Use a TT when they have one.
Interesting article in this respect at http://www.webbikeworld.com/Motorcycle-tires/sizes.htm
Don’t buy cheap tires. You get what you pay for, and a tire is what keeps your face off the asphalt. If you
have to make an emergency brake manoeuvre, the difference between a Bridgestone and a Cheng-shin
can make the difference between a metre to spare and a bent fork...or a lot, lot worse. Keep that in mind.
Now we will go down the list again and add some general comments about the various tires listed. These
come from a website from which I have shamelessly stolen them, alas, I’ve lost the URL and cannot find it
anymore. Thank you, whoever you are !
Avon :
325-19 54H AM20 front at 2,30 bar or 33 psi (“Roadrunners”)
400-18 64H AM21 rear at 2,50 bar or 36psi (“Roadrunners”)
Avon's bias-ply general purpose tyre. It's an excellent cruiser or touring tyre. Dry and wet traction are very
good, and the progressive profile of the front gives excellent straight-line stability with a linear profile once
leaned over.
First tire choice of Mark Weiss.
Brett "Boocephus" Mitchell opines about Avons: Is it just me or do Road Runners only last a few thou? I
only have 10K miles on my new speedometer and I know I've gone though 2 or 3 rear Avons. They are
nice and sticky, but they get squared off in what seems like no time. I am probably one of the only non-
overinflators on the list. I target for about 34, but I don't put any in until it gets below 30.
Phil Marx : I've had no good luck with the Avons, even sent pics of the tread cracks to Avon and they sent
replacement tires. Big deal, I'd rather not have tires that split.
Phil also adds that the 325-19 and 400-18 sizes are hard to get in the US, and thinks that most of these
axperiences have been with the (nearly) equivalent front Avon Roadrunner AM 20, 100/90x19
and rear Avon Roadrunner AM 21 110/90x18. On top of that the 100/90-19 AM20 seems no longer
available, and is substituted by the100/90-19 Venom X
Another Philip : My first Avon (AM21) ran 10414 miles. It had some cracking but not near as bad as Phil's.
The second Avon ran 9244 with no cracking. I installed a new front (AM20) with my first Avon rear and
used it for both the listed rear tires (21903 miles). My current Avon rear has 6322 and still looks great.
Super Venom (AM20/AM18)
Without doubt, this is the finest bias-ply sport tyre available. The straightline stability combined with linear
profile once the bike leans (also shared with the Roadrunner) makes it an excellent choice to combine
with a harder-wearing rear. Like the Roadrunner, it also works very well indeed with tyres from other
manufacturers.
The downside of the Super Venom is that the AM18 rear wears quickly, and squares off easily. While
unquestionably superb for sport riding, this has drawbacks for bikes that are used for other purposes. In
those cases, I suggest combining the Super Venom AM20 front with a harder-wearing rear, such as the
dual-compound Bridgestone BT45 rear.
Some narrow sizes of the Super Venom rear can also be fitted on the front. I would personally choose an
AM20 front over an AM18 every time, because of the former's profile, but there are some sizes the AM20
does not cover. In that case, an AM18 front is a good sport choice.
On the “Venom”, snurt1958 says that it served pretty well.
We have no opinions yet on the currently spec-ed “Roadriders”, or the “Speedmaster/Safety Mileage
MKII” combination. Experiences welcome.
Bridgestone :
100/90-19 Spitfire S11 front
110/90-18 Spitfire S11 rear
If the price is right, this is a good choice. It's a dual-compound tyre, with harder rubber in the centre of the
tread for longer life droning down the highway, and a relatively softer compound on the edges of the tyre.
Unlike the BT45, however, the "softer" does not mean it's up to sport riding, just that it gives better
traction than one would expect for a tyre that lasts reasonably long. It's a decent general-purpose tyre, a
good choice for commuters or those with a tight budget.
Paul Sotrop likes these better than Conti’s and less than Dunlop 491’s.
Someone else says : For me, the Bridgestone Spitfire has been an outstanding tire. It's a dual compound
tire, meaning the rubber in the center of the tire is a slightly harder compound, and the rubber on the
shoulders is a slightly softer compound. I've yet to run into any trouble with these tires, and I've got
probably about 4,000 miles on them. There's plenty of tread left. They're very reasonably priced as well,
about $80 per tire from Dennis Kirk.
Lyman Robertson says : I use Bridgestone S11 I have good service from them usually up to 20,000 rear
and about 2x as long front, wet, dry, hot, cold, doesn't matter twisties, straight away up hills down My
R90/6 and current /5.
Second best tire for Nick Grear, behind Michelin 50e and before Dunlop K491. Pricing (Front $50.97) and
(Rear $57.97)
They seem to last 11.000 to 14.000 + miles.
3,25-19 54H TL BT-45F front at 2,5 bar or 35 psi
4,00-18 64H TT BT-45R rear at 2,8 bar 38,5 psi
(or some equivalent sized Battlaxes ...)
Battlax BT45
This tyre is available in both H- and V-rated versions; aside from the speed rating and range of sizes,
there's no perceivable difference between the BT45H and BT45V. The rear has a dual tread compound
construction that combines a harder central band, to resist squaring off and for longer life, with a softer,
stickier compound on the edges.
This is a superb tyre. This is the model with which Bridgestone introduced their new silica-rich compound,
and thus took an enormous leap in wet traction. Also, the dual tread compound works exactly as
described -- it wears well in normal riding, while the outer edges stick very well. It's even capable of hard
track use -- I've used it that way on both ends of the weight range, a track-prepped Yamaha RD400 and a
Moto Guzzi California 1100i.
There is no question that a pair of BT45's is one of the best bias-ply sets you can buy.
If your bike is easy on front tyre wear, though, and the sizes work out, using a BT45 rear with an Avon
Super Venom front is an unbeatable combination. The Avon adds excellent highway stablity, confidence-
inspiring profile, and ultra-sticky traction, while the BT45 wears well and sticks very well in the corners.
The Avon, designed to work well with a wide range of rears (note that Avon themselves say you can
combine it with other manufacturers' products), lives up to its promise; while Bridgestone has finally
perfected the dual-compound rear.
Cris is still using these, and happy with performance and mileage. He gets 10.000 km from the rear,
20.000 km from the front (that’s 6/12000 mi). Performance is just fine. When worn out, the bike has more
of a tendency to wobble, that disappears with new tires. Properly tightening my steering head bearings
cured that.
Metzeler
4,00-18 64S TL ME77 rear at 2,3 bar or 33 psi
3,25-19 54S TL ME11 Perfect front at 2,2 bar or 31 psi
Lasertec (former Me33)
Me88/880
Tourance
Me77 Perfect Sporttouring / Allround Generic standard tyres.
The list wisdom says that Me11/Me77 combination is squirelly on rain grooves.
The Lasertec front had one list member rubbing the tire against the fender bracket bolt heads and had to
use spacer to slightly raise the front fender.
The information below is about the Me33/99, which has changed into the Lasertec. It may not apply any
longer.
ME33/99 is the third favourite of Mark Weiss, behind the Avon roadrunners and the Dunlop 591 (now
GT501 which doesn’t fit anymore)
Kim says his Metzeler ME33 Lazer requires 38 to 42 psi to feel right
Charlie Baker says : (old threads) Metzeler ME33 'Lazer's' (front) & ME99A 'Perfect' ( rear) have had the
same pattern for 30+ years. I like the front for handling, but they tend to cup rapidly on our weathered
roads, & the rear is ok, but I prefer the Dunlop 491's ( I have 19K on mine,vs 4-7k for the Metz)
Someone else says : My over-priced, shit mileage (barely 3500) Metzler ME99 is over-priced and shit
mileage (barely 3500). I like the ME33, it ran well with it's original ME99 rear and the Conti Blitz's I
replaced it with.
Still someone else adds : ME33 follows grooves
Dunlop
491 Elite II MM90-19 front at 2,3 bar or 32 psi
491 Elite II 110/90 B18 rear at 2,55 bar or 36 psi
The 491 sets the standard for bias-ply touring tyres. It is an excellent choice for touring and cruising bikes
alike. With the demise of the Avon Elan series, it becomes the undisputed leader for tread life under load.
For a touring tyre, it performs very well in wet and dry. The profile is particularly well suited to cruisers --
the less rounded profile of the rear when compared to other brands can give the effect of extra ground
clearance. Harley-Davidson riders swear by these much like BMW riders swear by Metzelers, and for
good reason. They're excellent tyres. It is not entirely certain they are still available at the moment though.
Everyone on 5united seems to love the high mileage you get out of these tires. They do, however, not
seem too sticky. Someone mentioned bouncing his butt off the pavement three times, without mentioning
however *which* Dunlop tires he did that on.
We have no opinions so far of anyone that used either
the Elite 3 front, D401 Cruiser at 100/90-19 57H Front, F24 100/90-19 TT 57S Front, F11 100/90-19 57H
Front K627 110/90-18 rear, K70 3.25-19TT 54P front or K70 4.00 18 64S rear
According to list comments, the F11 front last a looong time. (13.000+ miles)
GT501 100/90-19 57V
GT501 120/90-18 65V
This is a replacement for the well-respected K591. It fills the same niche, that of a bias-ply performance
tyre, but with an updated compound and tread pattern. I have not had much experience of these tyres --
first- or second-hand -- and so I'm not sure how they perform. I see no reason, however, to doubt that
they're a good tyre.
No list opinions on these.
Continental
Someone says : Conti still cranks out the RB2/K112 & Blitz tires in the right sizes but I wouldn't consider
either a sport tire.
Paul Sotrop says : period appropriate Continental tires. They wore out quickly at about 3000-4000 miles,
were scary in wet weather, and terrifying on metal-grate bridges.
Philip Rose says : I am still partial to the original Conti Twins. The RB2 front and the K112 Rear.
Continental is still making these tires and they fit correctly, look correct and still give great performance
K112 was stocked by Bondo back when Dunlop K81’s could still be bought.
Kim says : my /5 Continental Super Twin (TK22 /TK44) used to require 40 to 46 psi to feel right.
Ian Hamilton had an issue with the TK44 rubbing his rear shaft drive when just mounted.
No-one seems to have used the new TKH23 TKH24 combination.
Michelin
Here we have to be careful, as Michelin seems to have made a lot of changes to their 50/50E/50H/50S
line in these past few years. The comment you read may not be applicable to the Macadam tires they sell
right now.
I've had good experience with Michelin Macadam 50s. Michelin tubes worked fine too.
Michelin recently updated the front tire to the Macadam 50H which is supposed to limit cupping of the
front tire, a problem not unique to Michelin on BMWs and one which I've not experienced with my
Macadam 50. I don't think you can go wrong with these tires and they're fairly priced, too.
I will heartily second Phil's recommendation of the Macadams but I would advise using the 50E on the
front. Both my wife & I have had the 50 cup badly on our bikes & I believe it was replaced by the 50E last
year so any 50s are old stock.
I'm a happy Macadam rider - 25,000+ on my SWB 75/5 with just one front and three rear tires.
First choice of Nick Grear, before Bridgestone S11 and Dunlop K491 (Front $62.97) and (Rear $76.97)
Pirelli
Pirellis are made by the same company that makes Metzelers, and in general there's a fairly direct
product comparison between the product lines; one big difference is that the comparable Metzeler is
usually the cheaper of the two.
Brent and Mihai have Pirelli’s on their bikes, but they may not be any of the models listed above ...
comments welcome.
Cheng Shin
Awful "tyres", both in design and in quality. These are the worst you could possibly buy -- don't do it under
any circumstances. Kenda and IRC are vastly superior at a similar cost.
They scream and howl in corners according to Lawrence Hogarth. It may be safer not to use them. Your
life probably is worth more to you than the 40$ difference per tire with a proper one.
Jonathan Burdsall writes :
Some folks have reported that they are happy with them, I think they are way too easy to please.
Aside from my own experience years ago, which was not a particularly good one, my son put a set of
them and then Kendas on his Kawasucki. I had warned him about going from his dunlops to the chinese
tires so he played with them a bit. He found that both break loose much earlier in both acceleration and
braking. The later being much more disturbing than the former. He also found that the bike felt a bit
kludgier in corners, with the backend feeling looser than with the dunlops.
Kenda
Larry is happy with his Kenda Cruiser on the front -8000 mi, plenty of tread left.
Bill Rice had stability issues with a Kenda Challenger on the back matched with a Michelin Macadam on
the front.
A 120/90 Kenda challenger does not fit according to Charles Schiff.
IRC
Mark Weiss writes :
An often overlooked tire brand is IRC. They are cheap tires that are surprisingly decent. For most street
use you would never know the difference between IRCs and Metzlers
Thanks goes to Eldon Brown for the idea and setting this off.
