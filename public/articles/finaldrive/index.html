                <div class="col-md-8 description">
                  <p>
                    A common problem with the /5 is that some of the
                    oil from the
                    driveshaft housing leaks into the final drive. The indication of this
                    problem is that when one removes the final drive filler plug, oil runs
                    out. You must find, and correct, the paths that the oil follows to get
                    into the final drive. There are 3 of them. A good BMW mechanic should
                    know that. You should question your prospective mechanic and if he
                    doesn't know that, hit the road. Take it to a good mechanic. You can
                    remove the final drive and take it in without the bike.
                  </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-4 image">
                  <img src="./drive.jpg" class="img img-fluid img-thumbnail"/>
                </div>
              </div>

              <p>The final drive doesn't need to have the cover taken off for this job. I would remove the cover anyway
                because the life of the final drive is the gear wear. I would want to inspect the gear wear and correct
                it
                if it is wrong, before you must buy the gears too. Another reason for removing the cover is that the
                brakes
                would sometimes get wet with oil. The drain hole didn't help here. The drain hole only drains oil that
                leaks
                past the seal. Check the drain hole yearly, with a wire, to see that it is clear. It is located just
                below
                the axle nut.</p>

              <p>The higher oil level, caused by transfer, causes excessive pressure in the final drive. Then the oil
                leaked
                along the threads of the 10 studs that hold the big round cover plate. This is why the oil got onto the
                brakes, and was a safety issue. This was a frequent occurrence in 70-71. The big nut holding the splined
                gear must be removed using a special tool. The threaded ring that holds the seal must be removed using a
                special tool. Clean everything totally.</p>

              <p>The three paths for oil leaking into the final drive are:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Past the seal, in the old days this was the least likely path. Replace the seal.</li>

                <li>Down the splines on the inside of the gear. Goop them up.</li>

                <li>Along the threads of the seal holder. Goop them up.</li>
              </ol>

              <p>When these bikes were new, they often leaked (transferred) oil badly. We could fix one without
                replacing
                any parts. The parts weren't bad, the manufacture and assembly of the parts was less than perfect. Isn't
                that diplomatic? The early models in 1970 had miss-machined covers. A recessed groove was allowing oil
                to
                get to the threads. We just filled it with goop. Where I say "goop", we used Hylomar, but I hear that
                many
                modern types of goop are good. Hylomar HPF. Available at auto supply stores with the rest of the
                Permatex
                products. The Permatex part number is 25249.</p>

                  <p>I see this problem all the time. When I do the service I
                    disassemble the final drive completely and inspect. I replace all
                    three seals and apply "goop" as you say, in the appropriate areas to
                    prevent leakage. Doing it right and doing the complete job at one time
                    leads to lots of trouble free miles. On the other hand; doing half the
                    job leads to future leakage problems that end up costing more than if
                    you do the whole job right the first time.</p>
