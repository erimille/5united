            <div class="col-md-8 description">
              <p>On
                BMW motorcycles, the
                excitation circuit sends a voltage from the voltage regulator, through
                the rotor brushes and into the rotor windings. The voltage flows
                through the rotor windings and electromagnetic waves (flux) forms
                around the rotor windings (you can't see 'em, but they're there).
                The flux has a north pole and a south pole. The flux rotates as
                the rotor rotates. When the invisible flux passes through the stator
                (stationary) windings, a voltage is induced in the stator windings.
              </p>

              <P>There are three sets
                (phases) of windings in the stator. As the north and south pole
                of the rotor's flux alternately pass through the stator's three
                phase windings, an alternating positive and negative voltage (alternating
                current AC) is induced in each phase winding. </P>
            </div>

            <div class="col-md-4 image">
              <img src="./rotor.jpg" class="img img-fluid img-thumbnail pull-left"/>
            </div>
          </div>


          <P> The 3-phase AC output
            of the stator is conducted into the rectifier (diode board). A diode
            acts like an electronic check valve and allows only the positive
            voltage from the stator's 3-phase AC output to flow through. The
            diode board output voltage polarity is always positive (direct current
            DC). </P>
          <P> The DC output of the
            diode board is conducted into the storage battery for later use
            when the engine isn't running or to augment the electrical power
            (watts) available for when the engine is running at low speed and
            big system electrical loads (horn, lights, etc.) are switched on.</P>
          <P> The faster the rotor
            spins, the greater the induced stator voltage. The voltage regulator
            acts to reduce the excitation voltage supplied by the voltage regulator
            to the rotor. Less excitation voltage equals less flux and less
            induced voltage in the stator windings. So, as the rotor spins faster,
            the voltage regulator reduces the voltage supplied to the rotor
            which ensures that there is not too much voltage induced into the
            stator. In this way, the voltage regulator controls the alternator
            output voltage level.</p>

          <P><B>Tip:</B> The red
            light on the speedo face is in the excitation circuit for the rotor.
            If the bulb is the wrong wattage or is burned out, then the alternator
            output will either be wrong or non-existent. Also, if the red gen
            light does not come on with the key on and engine off, then there
            is a break in the excitation circuit caused by burned out bulb,
            broken rotor wire, brush not making contact with slip ring, voltage
            not supplied from voltage regulator to rotor, bad circuit connection,
            etc.. </p>

          <P><B>Tip:</B>If the brushes
            are dirty or the brush holders or rotor slip-rings are dirty then
            you could get diminished alternator output.
          </P>
